# EX3D-Viewer
A 3D viewer made with OpenGL library. I tried to get familiar with rendering pipelines in this project. Besides, there are several shader adjustments that you can make your desired look out of your model.

It contains lots of comments, so it's easy to read and learn from it. This project could be convenient to test vertex and fragment shaders on meshes but still needs some work to get it right for that purpose.

To compile the project you can use VS 2019 and above.
